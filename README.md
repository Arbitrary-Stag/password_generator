# Password Generator

## Description
This is the third challenge of the UC Berkeley Web Development bootcamp in which we were challenged to write the JavaScript code for a password generator. The CSS and HTML files were provided in this assignment.

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
Once the user has navigated to the webpage they will be greeted by simple interface in which they can click a button to "Generate (a) Password." The user will then be asked a series of questions that will determine how long the password should be, and what types of characters it should contain. If the user fails to select an appropriate length, or fails to choose at least one of the available character types an error message will appear.

## Credits
The CSS and HTML of this code were provided by the bootcamp. The JavaScript I wrote alone; occasionally consulting google and youtube for assistance.
